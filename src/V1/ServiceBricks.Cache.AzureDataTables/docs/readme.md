Visit http://ServiceBricks.com to learn more.

## Overview

Service Bricks is a modular, service-oriented architecture (SOA) for building microservices using .NET.
It provides a templated design that exposes a standardized API that works the same, regardless of the backend storage provider.

Service Bricks is scalable and can grow with your ogranization.
Run all of your bricks in a single web application or a fully distributed containerized network.
We offer many pre-built services, examples and provide source code so you can build your own bricks quickly.

The platform utilizes Service Query to provide dynamic querying of data over service boundaries.
